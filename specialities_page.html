            <strong>Why Robotic Surgery?</strong>
            <p>With the help of robotic surgery, doctors can perform many types of complex procedures compared to what is possible with conventional techniques. Generally, robotic surgery is associated with minimally invasive surgery (MIS), which means that the procedure is performed through smaller incisions. However, it is also sometimes used alongside certain conventional open surgeries. While performing a traditional minimally invasive surgery, the surgeon uses hand-held instruments that cannot bend or rotate.</p>
            <p>In addition, the surgeon needs to stand as well as look up and away to a standard 2D video monitor during the course of the operation to see an image of the target anatomy.</p>
            <p>The da Vinci TM system is highly ergonomic, which means that the surgeon operates the system from the console</p>
            <p>while viewing the target anatomy in magnified and high definition 3D and with full control of the surgical instruments</p>
